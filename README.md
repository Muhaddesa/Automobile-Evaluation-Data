# Automobile-Evaluation-Data


This dataset contains information on the cost and physical attributes of several thousand cars. Originally,
this dataset was used for to train a classification model that assigned an acceptability score/category to cars based on these attributes.

The car evaluation dataset has been sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and has been slightly modified for this project. 
Specifically, one additional field manufacturer_country has been simulated for illustrative purposes.
